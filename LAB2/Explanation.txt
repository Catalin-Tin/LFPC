/*
 * Description : 
			It reads in the NFA from "NFA.txt" and writes out the corresponding DFA to "DFA.txt".
			"NFA.txt" must have the following format:
				N M
				F a1 a2 ... af
				T
				s1 y1 T1 t1 t2 ... tt1
				s2 y2 T2 t1 t2 ... tt2
				 :
				 :
			Here, 	N -> No. of states (states are numbered 0 ... N-1), 0 is the start state
				M -> Size of input alphabet (input symbols are
					numbered 1 ... M and 0 is reserved for epsilon)
				F -> No. of final states, followed by F states ( 0 <= ai <= N-1)
				T -> No. of transitions, followed by T lines
				si -> Previous state ( 0 <= si <= N-1)
				yi -> Input symbol or epsilon ( 0 <= yi <= M)
				Ti -> No. of states the NFA moves from si on input yi, followed by Ti states
				
			"DFA.txt" will have the following format:
				N M
				F a1 a2 ... af
				s1 y1 t1
				s2 y2 y2
			 	:

			Here, 	N -> No. of states in the DFA (states are numbered 0 ... N-1), 0 is the start state
				M -> Size of input alphabet (input symbols are numbered 1 ... M)
				F -> No. of final states followed by F states ( 0 <= ai <= N-1)
				si -> Previous state
				yi -> Input symbol
				ti -> Next state
			Each line until the end of file contains one transition ( si yi ti )
